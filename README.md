## *Description* 
    
For this assignment I created a  team generator that consist of 3 specific roles; Manager, Engineer, and Intern - via command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team Manager and then information about the additional team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. Once the user is finished building their team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a dynamic team roster based on the information provided by the user.
